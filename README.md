# WeRateDogs-Data-Analysis
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates peopleâ€™s dogs with a humorous comment about the dogs. 

The analysis involved three datasets i.e.

- Enhanced Twitter archive data
The data set was provided by WeRatesDogs to be downloaded directly.
- Image predictions data
- Additional data from the Twitter API
I used Tweepy to query twitter's API for data in the WeRateDogs Twitter archive.

The questions I was looking to answer include:
- Is there a relationship between ratings and retweet and favorite counts?
- What are the top 10 most retweeted dogs?
- What are the top 10 most favorite dogs?
